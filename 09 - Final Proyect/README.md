# 🏃‍♀️ Running Tracker App

A simple console-based app to help you track your runs, view your progress, and calculate your pace.

![Running Tracker App](https://github.com/BrendaCantuL/Code-In-Place/blob/main/09%20-%20Final%20Proyect/Image.png?raw=true)

## 📋 Features

- Enter and store runs with date, distance (km), and time (minutes)
- Display all run entries in a clean table
- Automatically calculate pace in minutes:seconds per kilometer
- View total distance, total time, and average pace
- Simple, user-friendly menu loop

## 🛠️ How It Works

The app runs in your terminal. You'll be prompted to enter the date, distance, and time of your run. The app stores each run in a list and can display all your runs along with calculated stats like pace and total progress.

## 🧠 What I Learned

The most challenging part was calculating and formatting the pace into a readable min:sec format. Handling unexpected input and making the output easy to read also required some thoughtful logic. It was a great project for practicing loops, functions, and user interaction in Python.

## 💡 Future Ideas
Save data to a file

Load past runs automatically

Add basic visualization or charts

Create a simple GUI version

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone this repo or download the script.
