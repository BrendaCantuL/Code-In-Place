# 🌟 Code in Place 2025 — My Journey

Welcome! This repo showcases my progress through [Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/) 2025 — a free, community-powered introduction to computer science taught by Stanford.

## ✨ About the Course

Code in Place is based on Stanford’s CS106A curriculum and introduces programming fundamentals through engaging projects, weekly assignments, and a final creative project. The course uses Python and emphasizes logical thinking, problem solving, and building with code.

## 🧩 What’s Inside

This repository contains the exercises, mini-projects, and final project I completed throughout the course.

### ✅ Week-by-Week Highlights

- **Week 1–2:** Learned variables, functions, conditionals, and loops
- **Week 3–4:** Practiced with graphics, debugging, and breaking problems into steps
- **Week 5–6:** Built interactive programs like Karel puzzles, memory games, and animations

### 🏁 Final Project — Running Tracker App

[📂 09 - Final Proyect](./09%20-%20Final%20Proyect/)  
My final project is a console-based **Running Tracker App** that lets users input their run details (date, distance, time), calculates pace in min:sec/km, and displays summaries including total distance and average pace.

🧠 *What I learned:* Formatting pace into readable time, validating user input, and organizing code with functions and loops were key takeaways. I also practiced creating clean output and making the app intuitive to use.

## 🎯 Skills Gained

- Python programming fundamentals
- Control flow, functions, and data structures
- Working with graphics (using `tkinter` and custom libraries)
- Problem decomposition and iterative design
- Creative thinking through code

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

Code in Place gave me confidence in writing Python code and solving problems step by step. I'm excited to continue building more projects, learn about automation, and explore data analysis and web development next.
